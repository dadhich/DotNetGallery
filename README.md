# Windows Photo Gallery

## Goal
To design and develop a modern, native Windows desktop application for managing and exploring image collections. The application will feature advanced, strictly local Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities for image understanding (object detection, classification, description), facial recognition, and natural language search, while adhering to high standards of code quality, security, and user experience

## Core Principles

- **Modularity**: Structure the application into distinct, loosely coupled modules (UI, Core Logic, Data Access, AI Services, Infrastructure) to promote maintainability, testability, and independent development.
- **Testability**: Integrate automated testing (unit, integration) from the outset as a fundamental part of the development workflow.
- **Security**: Embed security best practices throughout the design and implementation (secure file handling, input validation, dependency management, secure logging).
- **Local-First AI**: All AI processing (inference) must occur entirely on the user's machine. No reliance on cloud-based AI APIs or services is permitted.

## Core Components

### 1. User Interface Layer
- **Main Window**: Grid-view gallery display with sorting options
- **Image Viewer**: Full-size image display with zoom functionality
- **Chat Panel**: AI-powered interface for image descriptions and Q&A
- **Search Interface**: Natural language search capabilities
- **Settings Panel**: Application configuration

### 2. Application Layer
- **Image Manager**: Scanning, indexing, and organizing images
- **AI Service Orchestrator**: Manages all AI operations locally
- **Search Service**: Processes natural language queries
- **Face Recognition Service**: Identifies, clusters, and manages face data
- **Database Service**: Handles storage and retrieval operations

### 3. Data Layer
- **Image Database**: Stores image metadata, paths, and AI-generated attributes
- **Face Database**: Stores facial vectors, clusters, and user-assigned names
- **User Settings**: Stores user preferences and application settings

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) with MVVM architecture
- **UI Components**: Custom gallery controls, zoom-enabled image viewer
- **Styling**: Modern Windows UI design with customizable themes

### Backend
- **Language**: C# (.NET 8.0)
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage (no cloud dependencies)
- **Image Processing**: System.Drawing.Common and ImageSharp
- **AI Models**: 
  - ONNX Runtime for running pre-trained models locally
  - Local transformers for natural language processing
  - Local computer vision models for image understanding

### AI Components
- **Image Classification**: YOLOv8 or EfficientNet (converted to ONNX format)
- **Face Detection**: BlazeFace or RetinaFace
- **Face Recognition**: ArcFace or FaceNet
- **Natural Language Processing**: DistilBERT or similar compact models
- **Chat Interface**: Small-footprint LLM like LLAMA 3 (8B) or Phi-3

## Data Flow Architecture

1. **Image Processing Pipeline**:
   ```
   Scan Files → Extract Metadata → Generate Thumbnails → AI Classification → Store in Database
   ```

2. **Face Recognition Pipeline**:
   ```
   Detect Faces → Extract Face Embeddings → Cluster Similar Faces → Allow User Tagging → Update Face Database
   ```

3. **Search Pipeline**:
   ```
   Natural Language Query → Parse Intent and Entities → Search Database → Rank Results → Display Matching Images
   ```

4. **Chat Interaction Pipeline**:
   ```
   Load Image → Generate Description → Process User Questions → Extract Relevant Image Features → Generate Responses
   ```

## Security Considerations
- Local processing eliminates external API risks
- Proper error handling throughout the application
- No cloud services used, preserving privacy
- All data stored locally with optional encryption
- Sanitization of user inputs for search queries

## Performance Optimizations
- Asynchronous loading of thumbnails and full-size images
- Background processing for AI operations
- Efficient caching of frequently accessed images
- Lazy loading of AI models based on active features
- Multi-threading for processing images in batches

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for component interactions
- UI automation tests for user flows
- Performance benchmarks for AI operations
- Security tests for input validation

## Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for adding new AI models
- Customizable search queries and filters
- Export/import capabilities for user data
- Theming support for UI customization
